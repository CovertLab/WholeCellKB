## WholeCellKB
[WholeCellKB](http://wholecellkb.stanford.edu) is a collection of free, open-source model organism databases designed specifically to enable comprehensive, dynamic simulations of entire cells and organisms. WholeCellKB provides comprehensive, quantitative descriptions of individual species including:
* Cellular chemical composition,
* Growth medium composition,
* Gene locations, lengths, and directions,
* Transcription unit organization and transcriptional regulation,
* Macromolecule composition,
* Reaction stoichiometry, kinetics, and catalysis, and
* Extensive links and cross-links to all references used to construct each model organism database.

See the [tutorial](http://wholecellkb.stanford.edu/tutorial) and the [about page](http://wholecellkb.stanford.edu/about) for more information about WholeCellKB how to use WholeCellKB as well as how it was design, implemented, and curated.
